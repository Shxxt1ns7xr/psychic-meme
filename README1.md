#Calculator - README

A fully functional scientific calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The project features a responsive, card-based layout with a distinct color hierarchy for operational logic (numeric, arithmetic, and scientific functions). 
Key capabilities include trigonometric calculations (sin, cos, tan), square roots, exponents, and standard arithmetic operations.
